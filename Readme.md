### Running:
1) Run `gradle build` to build the jar
2) The Jar is in build/libs
3) Get config file from releases
4) Edit config file for your needs.
5) Start the bot with `java -jar bot-v2.jar <path to config file>`

### Compatibly:

#### Windows:
I don't have a computer with windows to test on. It'll most likely work, but I can't test.

#### Linux:
It's fully compatible with Linux

#### macOS:
Same deal as windows
