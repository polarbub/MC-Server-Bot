### Todo:
- Webhooks for chat bridge people
- Clean up ugly code
- URLS
- Replys
- Attachments
- Git push automatically
- Show less on backup in console channel
- Censor ips
- Fix permissions part of config file
#### Low priority:
- Show bot count in .status
- Use json builder for discord chat bridge -> mc
- emoji lookup


### Help:
1) Build w/ `gradle build`
2) Jar is in build/libs
3) Use config file from releases
4) Edit config file for needs.
5) No jvm args are needed so start w/ java -jar bot-v2.jar
